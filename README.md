A **gradient background in CSS** is a smooth transition between two or more colors. Instead of using a single solid color, you can use gradients to create more attractive and modern-looking backgrounds.

### ðŸ’¡ Example in CSS:

```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff7e5f, #feb47b);
}
```

This creates a beautiful warm sunset-style background.
